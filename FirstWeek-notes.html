<b>The basics of the web</b>

<p>The web is a collection of many computers. Within the web, computer can mutually
  send out and exchange data, text, pictures, music etc. A webpage is usually
  created in <em>HTML</em>, where people can get access to those different
  types of contents online. People ask computer to send out <em>HTTP</em> requests
  to <em>URLs</em>, which represent the location of computers (or <em>server</em>)
  online. The <em>HTML</em> content can be translated by <em>web browser</em> and
  displayed by the screen. A sample webpage is <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">
  this</a>.

  of the online documents and materials. HTML consists of <i>text</i> and <i>markup</i>.
  They define what contents a webpage have and how the contents are shown to the users.

<b>Important Tags</b>
<p> <em>Tags</em> play an key role in telling the <em>web browser</em> the type
  of the <em>HTML</em> element so that it knows how to correctly show a HTML webpage.
  Important tags include: <b>b tag</b>, <em>em tag</em>,
  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">a tag</a>, (will start a new line)
  <br> br tag and so on.

<b>Inline and Block</b>
<p>The HTML elements can be categorized as <b>inline</b> as well as <b> block</b>.
  For example, <em>br tag</em> is inline and <em>p tag</em> is block, which will
  usually provide an invisible box and put every piece of information inside.
