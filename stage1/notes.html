        <h3>The basics of the web</h3>
        <p>
          The web is a collection of many computers. Within the web, computer can mutually
          send out and exchange data, text, pictures, music etc. A webpage is usually
          created in <em>HTML</em>, where people can get access to those different
          types of contents online. People ask computer to send out <em>HTTP</em> requests
          to <em>URLs</em>, which represent the location of computers (or <em>server</em>)
          online. The <em>HTML</em> content can be translated by <em>web browser</em> and
          displayed by the screen. A sample webpage is <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">
          this</a>.

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
          HTML means <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. It is essentially the basic and major type
          of the online documents and materials. HTML consists of <i>text</i> and <i>markup</i>.
          They define what contents a webpage have and how the contents are shown to the users.
          We can refer to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp"> this
          page</a> to learn more about <em>HTML</em>.

        <h3>Important Tags</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Tags</em> play an key role in telling the <em>web browser</em> the type
          of the <em>HTML</em> element so that it knows how to correctly show a HTML webpage.
          Important tags include: <b>b tag</b>, <em>em tag</em>,
          <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">a tag</a>, (will start a new line)
          <br><b>br tag</b> and so on.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='notes'>
        <h3>Inline and Block</h3>
        <p>
          The HTML elements can be categorized as <b>inline</b> as well as <b> block</b>.
          For example, <em>br tag</em> is inline and <em>p tag</em> is block, which will
          usually provide an invisible box and put every piece of information inside.
        </p>

        <h3>The Special Structure of HTML</h3>
        <p>
          The HTML documents have a special nested structure, like tree. Although this might sound
          intimidating in the beginning, it helps in organizing things into boxes at diffrent levels.
          In general, the tree-like structure comes from the idea of boxifying.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can refer to this picture to have an initial imprssion of the HTML structure.

          alt="Here should be a pic of sample HTML structure">
        <p>
          <em>Notes</em>: HTML and CSS are both languages; HTML controls the <em>content</em>
          and <em>format</em> of a webpage. On the other hand, CSS controls the <em>style</em>
          of displaying the HTML webage, e.g. colors, margin, size etc.; DOM(Document Object
          Model) refers to the tree-like structure of a webpage specifically.

        <h3>Several Ways to Include CSS</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Write CSS in the <u><em>&lt;head&gt;</em></u> of HTML document</li>
          <li>Link HTML to a seperate CSS file(in the same folder along with the HTML document)</li>
          <li>Put down the styling code inline inside HTML</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summary of Playing with Boxes</h3>
          <h4>Box Sizing</h4>
            <p>
              There are two ways to specify box sizes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Set sizes in terms of percentage but not pixels, so that box sizes
                  can be self-adpated when other changes are applied</li>
              <li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.</li>
            </ul>

          <h4>Box Positioning</h4>
            <p>
              Divs are block elements, so they will take up the entire width of a page. Adding the rule
              <strong>display:flex;</strong> to the approriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next
              to each other.

        <h3>Useful tips</h3>
          <div class='Tip One'>
            <h4><em>Revert Temporary Styling Changes</em></h4>
            <p>
              We can modify the style settings via <span style="color:red">Developer Tools</span>. For example, we can change the margin
              of an invisible box. If we don't like the changes, <span style="color:blue">refreshing</span>
              the page should be able to help us revert the changes.
            </p>

            <h4><em>How to Listen to Expert</em></h4>
            <p>

              ask questions when talking to others.
